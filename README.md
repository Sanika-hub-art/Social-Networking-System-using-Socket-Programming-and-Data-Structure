 A basic social networking system using Java socket programming and various data structures. It includes a server and client to simulate user interactions, with features such as user registration, friend requests, messaging, and message retrieval. Users can create accounts, manage friendships, and send and receive messages. The server uses classes, maps, sets, lists, and atomic integers to manage user data, friendships, and messages, while the client offers a text-based interface for interaction. Implemented in Java, this system demonstrates fundamental server-client communication and social networking functionalities.
